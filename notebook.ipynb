    "# Live-stock detection (DeepForest)\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "Implement and fine-tune a prebuilt Deep Learning model to detect livestock in airborne imagery. The model is implemented using PyTorch Lightning, which simplifies the training process and allows for easy checkpointing, enabling collaborative work by saving and sharing model progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modelling Approach\n",
    "The [live-stock detection model](https://huggingface.co/weecology/deepforest-livestock) from the latest version (v1.4.0) of the [DeepForest](https://deepforest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Deep Learning model is used to predict bounding boxes corresponding to cattle from airborn RGB images.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a PyTorch Lightning module, this model can be fine-tuned easily, and checkpoints can be saved as [.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/docs/safetensors/index), making it possible to upload the trained models to platforms like Hugging Face for open collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prebuilt model was trained on a [limited dataset](https://new.wildlabs.net/discussion/global-model-livestock-detection-airborne-imagery-data-applications-and-needs). According to the package's documentation, \"the prebuilt models will always be improved by adding data from the target area\". As such, this notebook will explore the improvement in the model's performance in live-stock detection from fine-tuning on local data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "This notebook will explore the capabilities of the DeepForest package. In particular, it will demonstrate how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Detect livestock in airborne imagery using the prebuilt livestock detection model.\n",
    "- Fine-tune the model using a novel publicly-available dataset.\n",
    "- Evaluate the model's performance before and after fine-tuning.\n",
    "- Save and share model checkpoints throughout the process, allowing for reproducibility and collaboration on Hugging Face.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"background-color: #ffe4b5; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #ffa500;\">\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> \n",
    "Due to the memory constraints of the Binder environment, some steps of the machine learning pipeline are omitted from the notebook. In such cases, we include the relevant code so that it can still be executed in an environment with greater memory and processing power.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "The prebuilt model was trained on 2347 training and 690 validation annotations, and its performance metrics on the test set (subset of 356 images excluded from training/validation sets) showed substantial gains:\n",
    "- __Box Recall:__ Improved from 0.3862 to 0.9391\n",
    "- __Box Precision:__ Improved from 0.4925 to 0.8628\n",
    "- __Mean IoU:__ Improved from 0.2070 to 0.6095\n",
    "\n",
    "These results demonstrate the potential of improving the model further by sharing checkpoints as open-source models on Hugging Face, enabling collaborative enhancements based on additional local data.\n",
